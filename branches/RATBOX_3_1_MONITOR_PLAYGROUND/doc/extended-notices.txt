################################################

Starting with ircd-ratbox-3.1, you now have yet another new format 
for server notices (at your discression, of course).

These notices are designed to be far easier to parse, regardless if
you are using Perl, Python, C, or any other language for your irc client,
or you are writing an irc bot.

Why another format: 
Long ago, in another century, irc daemons only had the default umode +c 
which displayed client's connecting and quitting. ircd coders at the time
were probably more concerned with readability, than usability... Meaning they
were easy to read (and i say that subjectivly), but were difficult to handle
with scripts without jumping though hoops.  Several years ago, ircd-ratbox
introduced CLICONNEXT (umode +C) notices, which were broken up more, were less
pre-formatted, and contained some extra information +c was missing. 
This allowed clients and scripts to read the notices, and handle/reformat them 
anyway they liked.  This was a great idea, and I believe it to
be a success. The only problem is, client connections, quits, and ETRACE's are the only
notices that use this new format.

Just as with CLICONNEXT, the new ENOTICE messages will be given to you 
IN ADDITION TO any other umode you have. So, you CAN use umode +ECc. This will
have the side-effect of seeing 3 CONNECT notices per client (or quits)


What they look like:

# just a draft of ideas for the irc-monitor api being thrown about for ratbox 3.1
# any ideas should be easily backported to 3.0.x 


basicly, you will be notified of server notices in a different format than human opers
for example:

# source.server <code> <nick> <user> <host> <ip> <class> <extra1> <extra2> :<string_info>

# disconnect
irc.he.net: ENOTICE 0 nobody ~nobody some.leet.host 255.255.255.255 lusers - - :<quit message>

# connect (default)
irc.he.net: ENOTICE 1 nobody ~nobody some.leet.host 255.255.255.255 lusers hi there :i am nobody special

# connect (sslified)
irc.he.net: ENOTICE 2 nobody ~nobody some.leet.host 255.255.255.255 lusers hi there :i am nobody special

# flood -> channel
irc.he.net: ENOTICE 3 nobody ~nobody some.leet.host 255.255.255.255 lusers - - :#some_flooded_channel

# flood -> user
irc.he.net: ENOTICE 4 nobody ~nobody some.leet.host 255.255.255.255 lusers - - :some_flooded_nick

# jupe
irc.he.net: ENOTICE 5 nobody ~nobody some.leet.host 255.255.255.255 lusers - #CHANNEL :jupe reason

# failed oper
irc.he.net: ENOTICE 6 nobody ~nobody some.leet.host 255.255.255.255 lusers - - :host mismatch or whatever

# nick change
irc.he.net: ENOTICE 7 nobody ~nobody some.leet.host 255.255.255.255 lusers - - :NEW_NICK

# too many hosts (local)
irc.he.net: ENOTICE 8 nobody ~nobody some.leet.host 255.255.255.255 - - :

# too many hosts (global)
irc.he.net: ENOTICE 9 nobody ~nobody some.leet.host 255.255.255.255 - - :

etc.. etc..
