-- ircd-ratbox-2.2.0rc2
- Fix compilation of contrib/
- Fix cores with unknown servers
- TESTMASK has been extended to take a gecos field, and match against CIDR
  ip masks.
- New operspy capable MASKTRACE command, works like testmask except actually
  lists those clients that match.
- Fix listener name for wildcard binds.
- Update some help files
- Fix a core in challenge.
- Rewrite the logic for match_esc() used by xlines, so that '@' doesnt match
  a literal '@' etc.
- Properly exit when we receive SIGTERM.
- Add some more log entries for when we drop new server connections.

-- ircd-ratbox-2.2.0rc1
- A large number of memory usage related cleanups which should cut memory
  usage by a noticable amount.
- CPU optimisations for the iline/kline/dline hash.
- Removed rate limiting of /away.
- Extend TESTMASK to take [nick!]user@host matches.
- New TESTMASKGECOS command, a TESTMASK for a gecos match.
- Hardcode hiding servers IPs.
- HIDE_SPOOF_IPS is now hide_spoof_ips = yes|no; in general {};
- New CHANTRACE command, an ETRACE for a channel.
- Mangle klines for user@1.2.3.* to user@1.2.3.0/24 etc.
- Improved installation documentation.
- Fix a potential core in kills from a server
- Various fixes when setting bans (klines etc) which help prevent overriding
  minimum wildcard limits
- Output from ircd -conftest is now more streamlined, and will use proper
  exit codes
- Fix bug where temporary nick resvs had a 60x longer duration than
  requested.
- Add rtsigio back in, an IO subsystem for linux, particularly 2.4 users who
  do not have epoll.
- Rewrote the CHALLENGE system.  The respond utils are now in their own tree
  and there is a native windows port.  See http://respond.ircd-ratbox.org
- Speed improvements to poll()
- configure option --with-maxclients is gone, maximum number of clients is
  now done via the /quote set option, with an upper bound of what the shell
  tells us our fd limit is.

  You can set the default set option maxclients via serverinfo {};
  default_max_clients = number;
- ERROR had somehow been lost from loading.
- Improved logging in situations where we disallow a servers link.
