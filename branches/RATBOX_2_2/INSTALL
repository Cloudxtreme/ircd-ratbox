ircd-ratbox installation guide

------------------------------

1. If you are upgrading from an older release, read the whats-new files in
   doc/.  These contain the important notes for changes between major
   versions.

2. Run the configure script.  By default it will attempt to install into
   /usr/local/ircd.  If you want it to install into this directory, then as
   root you must first:
     mkdir /usr/local/ircd
     chown youruser: /usr/local/ircd

   Then run everything as normal from your username.  ircd-ratbox will not
   run as root, *nor should any part of the build be run as your root user*.

   If you wish to install ircd-ratbox into a different directory, include
   the --prefix option:
     ./configure --prefix=/home/leeh/ircd

   If you are on a "small" network, namely less than 5000 users you should
   pass the --enable-smallnet option to reduce memory usage:
     ./configure --enable-smallnet

   If you wish ipv6 support, pass the --enable-ipv6 option:
     ./configure --enable-ipv6

   You should also configure how many clients your server will support with
   the --with-maxclients option:
     ./configure --with-maxclients=NUMBER

   If you wish support for ratbox-services, you should pass the
   --enable-services option:
     ./configure --enable-services

   See ./configure --help for more options.  Naturally options should be
   combined so configure is only run once.

3. Run make

4. Run make install

5. Change to the directory it installed to

6. Edit etc/example.conf and save it as etc/ircd.conf

7. Run bin/ircd
