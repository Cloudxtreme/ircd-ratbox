The type field denotes how the XLINE works and may be:
  0 - Send a warning to +r opers but allow user to connect.
  1 - Reject the user and send a warning to +r opers. (default)

The <gecos> field contains certain special characters:
  ? - Match any single character

  @ - Match any letter [A-Za-z]
  # - Match any digit [0-9]

To use a literal one of these characters, escape it with '\'.  A
