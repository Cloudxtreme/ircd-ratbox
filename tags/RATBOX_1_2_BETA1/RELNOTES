This is the current release candidate version of the 'stable' tree of 
ircd-ratbox.  This code is run at your own risk.

-- ircd-ratbox-1.2rc1
- added CIDR limits to classes, to limit the amount of connections in a
  given prefix allowed.
- added a reject cache, to handle people hammering the server when
  theyre banned
- added back split delay, the duration of time after a netsplit ends to
  come out of splitmode
- removed wildcard whois
- added /quote SET OPERSTRING to give the reply of an oper
- added /quote SET ADMINSTRING to give the reply used instead of
  operstring for an admin.
- added "operspy" logging into the ircd, this adds logging and the 
  usermode +Z.  the actual operspy commands are not included.
  
  this adds options into logging {};
    - fname_foperspylog = "path"; for local uses of operspy
    - fname_foperspyremotelog = "path"; for remote uses of operspy
  into general {};
    - operspy_admin_only, controlling whether +Z is shown to admins only
  into operator { flags = x; };
    - oper_spy, controlling whether an oper may use operspy commands
      if theyre patched in.
- the ircd will now burst nicks first, then channels.
- global "/names" now works properly again.
- massive quitstorm cleanups, this should dramatically cut the amount
  of cpu time used.
- fix to disallow our servers impersonating glines from other users
