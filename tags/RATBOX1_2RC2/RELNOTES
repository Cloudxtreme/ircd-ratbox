This is the current release candidate version of the 'stable' tree of 
ircd-ratbox.  This code is run at your own risk.

-- ircd-ratbox-1.2rc2
- removed owho/owhois, from contrib/ - use opercheats
- removed jupe from contrib/ - its just broken.
- fixed rest of contrib code, it wont broadcast wallops for local
  channels now.
- minor speedup to /list
- fixed bug with spoof lengths
- /trace will no longer give "routing information" during flatten_links
- fixed a possible core in the auth system
- removed the max_clients option from serverinfo {};, it didnt do anything

-- ircd-ratbox-1.2rc1
- fix a few bugs in the new channel membership code
- you may now specify "operspy" in oper_umodes/oper_only_umodes
- fixed the spoof notice stuff.  no_spoof_notice has gone back to being
  spoof_notice, which defaults to off.  If its set, the notice will be
  sent always, but if we're in HIDE_SPOOF_IPS, itll not give the real host
- opers are now exempt from knock-per-user limits
- a partial fix for the modunload core (seems to fix fbsd but not linux)
- fixed invite allowing users to go over the max_chans limit
- extended spoofs to be able to spoof user@host
- added spambot_exempt to auth { flags = ... }; to exempt a user from
  spambot checks in join/part
- the channel send code wasnt dealing with ONLY_CHANOPS properly, fixed.
- only show errors from unregged servers to admins.

-- ircd-ratbox-1.2beta1
- added CIDR limits to classes, to limit the amount of connections in a
  given prefix allowed.
- added a reject cache, to handle people hammering the server when
  theyre banned
- added back split delay, the duration of time after a netsplit ends to
  come out of splitmode
- removed wildcard whois
- added /quote SET OPERSTRING to give the reply of an oper
- added /quote SET ADMINSTRING to give the reply used instead of
  operstring for an admin.
- added "operspy" logging into the ircd, this adds logging and the 
  usermode +Z.  the actual operspy commands are not included.
  
  this adds options into logging {};
    - fname_foperspylog = "path"; for local uses of operspy
    - fname_foperspyremotelog = "path"; for remote uses of operspy
  into general {};
    - operspy_admin_only, controlling whether +Z is shown to admins only
  into operator { flags = x; };
    - oper_spy, controlling whether an oper may use operspy commands
      if theyre patched in.
- the ircd will now burst nicks first, then channels.
- global "/names" now works properly again.
- massive quitstorm cleanups, this should dramatically cut the amount
  of cpu time used.
- fix to disallow our servers impersonating glines from other users
