This is the current release of the 'stable' tree of ircd-ratbox.  In theory
this code should not break your network.

-- ircd-ratbox-1.3rc4
- new -conftest option to ircd that will just test the config file
- ERROR messages are now only accepted from possible servers
- opers can now dline upto /16
- stats p was testing the wrong flag, so showed hidden admins as [A]
- another servlink fix
- reenabled notices for clustered commands like unkline
- fixed possible resolver memory leak
- fix a reject cache issue that caused the unknown_list to get borked
- local admin requests are no longer paced, remote ones are paced less heavily
- ENDOF numerics are now sent when a command is rate limited
- fix for first param to HELP being empty
- local wallops are now sent as operwall
- fix to display right conf filename during errors
- disabled writev()
- kqueue code update

-- ircd-ratbox-1.3rc3
- servlink fix
- fix some writev() issues
- up the delayed exit time to 10 seconds
- fix a bug with the reject cache where we could end up exiting things twice

-- ircd-ratbox-1.3rc2
- ERROR will no longer send the IP of the client it is sending it to, as
  this can cause an IP leak with servers.
- fix to make stats_{i|k}_oper_only show in INFO
- added hide_error_messages = {yes|opers|no}; to general {};, controlling
  whether ERROR messages received are hidden to opers/admins, hidden to opers
  or visible to both.
- made ERROR log the full IP to ircd.log
- kqueue fix
- gline_min_cidr shouldve been testing <, not <=
- added gline_min_cidr6 to general {}, min cidr for ipv6 glines.  default
  is 48
- kicks originating from servers were being sent incorrectly to clients
- juped nicks now use ERR_ERRONEUSNICKNAME numeric
- juped chans now use ERR_BADCHANNAME numeric
- fixed some issues that caused drastic memory jumps on hub servers
  during bursts
- CAP_UID and uid related code is gone, its been implemented properly
  in -devel.
- ability to /kill locally now uses the new priv 'local_kill' (clients who
  have global_kill automatically get this priv).

  **IMPORTANT**
  Any users who do NOT have global_kill, will not be allowed to locally kill
  either unless you give them 'local_kill'.

-- ircd-ratbox-1.3rc1
- omotd uses numerics nows
- fix an adns bug where the resolver could hang and stop resolving clients
- use writev when we have it available.
- remove rt sigio support, it never really worked right
- updated epoll support
- STATS Y returns the number of clients currently in the class in the last
  value
- Make ping cookies be a bit more useful on boxes where rand() only returns
  up to 32K
- fix to disallow +beI modes starting with ':'
- can now specify the minimum length of CIDR glines, in general {}:
  gline_min_cidr = 16;
- added temp xlines, see /quote help xline.  note permanent purely numerical 
  xlines (ie "123") must now be specified with a time field of "0".
- cluster {}; entries are now listed in stats U
